## What is this?
This is a proof-of-concept Mac application to translate from english text to the equivalent ASL signs;
Currently the word or phrase needs to be written or pasted into the text field.

## Todo
- implement global context menu option (right-click -> "Translate text to ASL")
- implement global hotkey (select text in whichever application, press hotkey, the window with the video pops up and shows the sign)
